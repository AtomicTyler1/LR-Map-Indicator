# LR Map Indicator

This mod used to be called **LeftAndRightPlayerTerminal** before I renamed it for release. Hence the names still being it, I cannot bother to rename alot of stuff so in the file names and code it may be mentioned as that.

## About the mod

**Big thanks to @tacobox on discord for the asset bundle and the fixed position code.**

This mod is for people that may have a hard time doing the following:
- Quickly working out "On your left/right"
- Issues understanding lefts and rights
- Not fully understanding which direction to say to go

This mod may not be for everybody, but do not criticize anyone that uses it.

This mod is highly configurable:
- Fixed rotation L & R (Stops the text from going upside down)
- RGB Color configs for the Left indicator
- RGB Color configs for the Right indicator
