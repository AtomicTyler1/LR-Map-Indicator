# LR Map Indicator

This mod used to be called **LeftAndRightPlayerTerminal** before I renamed it for release. Hence the names still being it, I cannot bother to rename alot of stuff so in the file names and code it may be mentioned as that.

## About the mod

This mod is for people that may have a hard time doing the following:
- Quickly working out "On your left/right"
- Issues understanding lefts and rights
- Not fully understanding which direction to say to go

This mod may not be for everybody, but do not criticize anyone that uses it.

So this mod effectively changes the model of the player looking and simply replaces it with the same model but added big text on the side.
This does mean the text can be upside down, which may be confusing but hopefully still provide enough detail to work out which is **L** and **R**.
